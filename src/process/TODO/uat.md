# User acceptance

The launch of any user-visible change or significant design change requires approvals from a number of people outside of the core engineering team that implements the change. Approvals are required to ensure that changes comply with legal regulations, privacy requirements, security requirements, reliability requirements (eg having appropriate automatic monitoring to detect server outages and automatically notify the appropriate engineers), business requirements, and so on.

We don't distinguish between "releases" and "launches" but launches may sometimes need extra attention.

The launch process is also designed to ensure that appropriate people within the company are notified whenever any significant new product or feature launches.
