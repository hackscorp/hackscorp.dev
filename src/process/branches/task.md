<!--

Engineers are encouraged to keep each individual change small, with larger changes preferably broken into a series of smaller changes that a reviewer can easily review in one go. This also makes it easier for the author to respond to major changes suggested during the review process. Very large changes are often too rigid and resist reviewer-suggested changes.

One way in which keeping changes small is encouraged is that the code review tools label each code review with a description of the size of the change. Changes with up to 99 lines added/deleted/removed may be "small", with changes up to 499 being medium, and anything above that being large. The appropriate breakpoints will vary between projects, dependent upon (for example) the abstraction level.
