# Process

Agile is meant to be about adaptability, but too often constraints such as timeboxes (aka sprints) and story points (estimates) turn it into a rigid workflow framework.

We focus on lightweight, adaptable processes.

There are no rules. You cannot go and buy a methodology and treat that as being "the way you write code". That's because software development is actually more of a craft than an engineering discipline. All of the so called "best practices" are contextual. They are only best practices if they fit the dynamic of a particular team working on a particular set of requirements in a particular stage of a product's lifecycle. What works in those circumstances probably won't work in the next project, or even in the next sprint on the same project.

We want to avoid canned ideas of how to do things. There is no methodology that is "agile in a box".
