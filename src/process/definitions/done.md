# Definition of done

A story or task is considered "done" when the following criteria are met:

- Code is written according to our coding standards and best practices.
- The code has been peer reviewed, and all comments have been addressed.
- All code quality gates (eg linting, coverage) have passed.
- Technical documentation has been authored or edited, as necessary.
- Any technical debt accrued during development is accepted by technical peers and recorded
- Acceptance criteria have been met.
- Design criteria have been met.
- The code changes have been appropriately tested, for example at the right testing levels.
- Successful execution (eg green build) in the CI/CD pipeline, including requisite test execution, static analysis and other quality gates.
- Development associated with the story/task has been deployed to the correct environment.
- With regards to the acceptance criteria, all relevant tests have been executed and the test output recorded shows they have passed (not withstanding residual defects, see below).
- Any residual defects have been triaged, and either fixed or accepted for deferral.
- Has been demonstrated to the relevant BA.
- Has been accepted by the PO (Product Owner).
- Key architectural decisions are recorded.
- Pre- and post-deploy tasks are automated or, where necessary to remain manual, have been defined and captured in relevant documentation space.
- Knowledge transfer documentation is completed, as required.
- The status of the story/task is up-to-date to reflect the appropriate terminal state (eg done, closed, won't do), including all sub-tasks.

For epics:

- All child stories related to the epic meet all the above criteria.
- The overall epic has been accepted by the Product Owner.
- The status of the epic in the ticket system is up-to-date to reflect its completion.
