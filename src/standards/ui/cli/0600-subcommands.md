# Subcommands

If you've got a tool that's sufficiently complex, you can reduce its complexity by making a set of subcommands. If you have several tools that are very closely related, you can make them easier to use and discover by combining them into a single command (for example, RCS vs Git).

They're useful for sharing stuff: global flags, help text, configuration, storage mechanisms.

Be consistent across subcommands. Use the same flag names for the same things, have similar output formatting, etc.

Use consistent names for multiple levels of subcommand. If a complex piece of software has lots of objects and operations that can be performed on those objects, it is a common pattern to use two levels of subcommand for this, where one is a noun and one is a verb. For example, `docker container create`. Be consistent with the verbs you use across different types of objects.

Either `noun verb` or `verb noun` ordering works, but `noun verb` seems to be more common.

Don't have ambiguous or similarly-named commands. For example, having two subcommands called `update` and `upgrade` is quite confusing. You might want to use different words, or disambiguate with extra words.
