# Help

If a command or sub-command _requires_ one or more arguments or flags, you SHOULD design the command to return help text by default, when no arguments or flags are provided. So `my-tool cmd` would produce an abbreviated version of the output from `my-tool cmd --help` and `my-tool cmd -h`.

Obviously, this is not possible for simple commands that do exactly one operation, and for programs that read input interactively (eg `cat`).

The abbreviated help text SHOULD include:

- A description of what the program or command does.
- The command's API signature, or one or two usage examples.
- Descriptions of the most useful flags.
- Instructions to use the `--help` flag to get more detailed information.

When `--help`/`-h` flags are passed, all other flags and arguments should be ignored, and an extended help text MUST be outputted. This SHOULD include the following:

- A more detailed description of what the program or command does.

- The command's API signature.

- OPTIONALLY, example invocations of common use cases. Users tend to use examples over other forms of documentation, so it is best to print these early in the help text. If it is useful, include the program's expected output in the examples, too.

- Descriptions of all available subcommands.

- Descriptions of all the available flags. If there are too many of these, list the most useful, and provide a link to online documentation of the rest.

- OPTIONALLY, a link to an online version of the documentation. If included, this MUST be versioned documentation, corresponding to the installed version of the program.

- OPTIONALLY, a link to provide feedback, log issues, or request support.

Help texts MAY be formatted. Make headings bold, for example, so the text is easier to scan. But do this only if it can be done in a terminal-independent way, so no user sees escape characters.

The `heroku` app has some of the best presented CLI help texts we've seen. The whole API is very easily discoverable through the help texts. There's no color, except some of the less important text is a mid-grey. It mostly uses plain text formatting, using mostly indentation to provide structure. Here are a few examples:

Finally, consider also providing your help texts via man pages. These are UNIX's original system of documentation, and they're still in use today. Many users reflexively check `man some-tool` as a first step when trying to learn a new tool. However, not everyone knows about `man`, and it doesn't work on all platforms. For this reason, man pages are an optional extra, and all important documentation MUST be accessible via the tool directly.
