# Command line interface (CLI) standards

This section covers high-level principles for the design of command line interfaces.

The focus here is on designing CLI utilities for UNIX-based environments, but many of these guidelines will be relevant to other software runtime environments — including Node, which is the other platform for which we write CLI programs.

This section does not cover the design of full-screen terminal programs, things like Emacs and Vim. This is all about designing interactive command-oriented CLI utilities.
