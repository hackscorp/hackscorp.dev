# Naming

The name of your program is particularly important on the CLI: your users will be typing it all the time, and it needs to be easy to remember and type.

Make it a simple, memorable word. But not too generic, or you'll step on the toes of other commands and confuse users. For example, both ImageMagick and Windows used the command `convert`.

Use only lowercase letters, and dashes if you really need to. `curl` is a good name, `DownloadURL` is not.

Keep it short. Users will be typing it all the time. Don't make it too short: the very shortest commands are best reserved for the common utilities used all the time, such as `cd`, `ls`, `ps`.

Make it easy to type. Some words flow across the QWERTY keyboard much more easily than others, and it's not just about brevity. `plum` may be short but it's an awkward, angular dance. `apple` trips you up with the double letter. `orange` is longer than both, but flows much better.
