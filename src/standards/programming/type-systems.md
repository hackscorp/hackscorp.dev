# Type systems

A good type system adds huge value.

A good type system should not carry much overhead, and the benefits should greatly outweigh those costs.

If the type system is well designed, it can almost fell like a dynamic language (via features like inference and flow analysis) while removing a whole class of issues that the compiler can handle far better and quicker than you can.
