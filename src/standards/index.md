# Standards

<!--

This section sets out our coding and design standards.

We need standards else different teams, and even different people within the same team, would build things very differently.

We use a narrow range of computer languages. Minimizing the number of different programming languages used reduces obstacles to code reuse and programmer collaboration. Specialized domain-specific languages may be used for particular purposes.

This section sets out style guides for each language. The purpose is to ensure that the code written across the whole organization is written with similar style, layout, naming conventions, etc.
