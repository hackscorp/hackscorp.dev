# Elements

## Naming

It is RECOMMENDED that the names of elements be just **one word**. Examples:

- `field`
- `action`
- `author`

For those elements that need two or more words to be suitably descriptive, concatenate the word with a single hyphen. Examples:

- `first-name`
- `last-name`
- `persona-avatar`
