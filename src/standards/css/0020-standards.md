# CSS language standards

Our frontend web application framework, Nirvarnia, and all of our application-level code, is written in standard CSS.

Plain CSS is the most stable and portable format. It is more enduring that extended CSS languages (aka CSS pre-processors), which are non-standard and will become obsolete over time.
