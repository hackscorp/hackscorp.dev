# CSS standards

This section documents how we write Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS is a surprisingly difficult computer language to work with. As computer programmers, we are trained to write _predictable_ programs. But CSS throws in a lot of unpredictability. It's system of cascading styles can be difficult to reason with, and the environments in which our CSS style sheets are translated to a rendered form are largely out of our control.

CSS as a computer language lives somewhere between a rigid, logic system like maths, and flexible, adaptive systems like human languages.

Most computer languages work in controlled environments, like servers or well-defined desktop operating systems. Certain conditions can be expected to be true at all times, and so the programs can be written as concrete instructions as to how the program should execute.

CSS works mostly in environments that can never be fully controlled. It's less about "programming the appearance" and more about translating a design into a set of rules that communicate _intent_.

Mastery of CSS requires knowledge not just of the technical details of the language, but the evolution of a certain mindset and a general sense of the ideas behind the language.
