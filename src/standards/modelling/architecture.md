# Architectural modelling

<!--

It is not necessary to use standard notations such as UML or C4. Just use the simplest diagrams you can come up with to convey how you view the systems. Boxes and arrows are fine!

Neither Microsoft nor Uber have hands-off software architecture positions. Engineers at higher levels are still expected to write code. It means that no one person owns the architecture of the design.

So, we do have **architects**, but their roles is to advise the engineers rather than to design solutions on their behalf. Design solutions are collaborative — no one person own the design, the whole team does.

When faced with a challenge that requires architectural modelling, the Tech Lead assembles a squad of engineers with appropriate areas of expertise:

- Start with the business problem
- Brainstorm the approach. Start at a high level
- Whiteboard your approach. Get the team together and have a person draw up the approach the team is converging on. You should be able to explain the solution on a whiteboard easily.
- Write it up as documentation with simple diagrams.
- Circulate the design and get feedback.

Clear design is similar to clean code. It is easy to read and easy to comprehend. Avoid jargon and aim for simplicity.

Knowing common architectural patterns helps to shorten discussions about design. But architectural patterns themselves are not the goal. They are no substitute for simple systems design. Rather, they are a set of vocabulary that helps us to discuss possible solutions.

Architectural patterns — like lower-level code design patterns — were born after engineers observed how similar design choices were made, and then gave the common patterns names. So, architectural patterns emerge _after_ solutions are found.

Our job as engineers is to solve solutions by learning from other people's solutions, rather than aiming for purity to any particular architectural design.
