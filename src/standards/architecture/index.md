# Architecture

This section is about the general high-level design and structure of software applications.

<!--

> The greatest limitation in writing software is out ability to understand the systems we are creating. The larger the program and the more people work on it, the more difficult it is to manage complexity. Good development tools can help us deal with complexity. But there is a limit to what we can do with tools alone. Simpler designs allow us to build larger and more powerful systems before complexity becomes overwhelming.

So, how do we fight complexity?

By encapsulating complexity via modular design and making code simple and obvious, like eliminating special cases or using consistent coding styles. The first part of the book focuses on good, modular design practices, while the second part of the book touches on techniques to make the code simple. Also, good commenting.

Architecture is critical to the success of a software product:

- Low level details such as code formatting have minimal impact on technical debt
- Mid-level details such as good use of design patterns and data structures has a big impact on technical debt

But the high-level details are the most expensive to get wrong. Mess up the architecture, and potentially you will have to, one day, burn the whole thing down and start over.
