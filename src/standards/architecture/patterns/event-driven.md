# Event-driven programming

-----

Event-driven programming is certainly more complex, due to no clear flow of control. But in real world scenarios, event-driven programming is often unavoidable for example in web client application interfaces (the platform is inherently event-driven) and in distributed systems, as well as multi-threaded environments, there is no other option.

Logging, monitoring and alerting become necessary to stay on top of such systems, and ensure they are working as expected at all times.
