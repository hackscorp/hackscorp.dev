# Product requirements documents (PRDs)

<!--

All the requirements for a (software) product. NOT concerned with HOW the product will fulfil the requirements, so doesn't get into the nitty gritty of user interface design or data schema, etc.

Components:

- Authors
- Purpose and scope, from both a business and technical perspective
- Stakeholder identification
- Target audience, demographics, and market segmentation
- Product overview
- Use cases
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements, including:
  - Performance and other such target metrics
  - Usability
  - Technical (security, network, platform, integration, ...)
  - Environments
  - Support requirements
  - Interaction / UI requirements (how the system should interact with other systems, and how people should interact with it)
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Dependencies
- Customer segment
- Problem to be solved
- Proposed solution
- Success metrics

Plus: high-level workflow pans, timelines and milestones.

The PRD has quite a lot of overlap with the business plan, but the BP is really for stakeholders and _external_ audiences (investors, lenders) while the PRD is for an internal audience. (The BP may include additional info such as the market need/opportunity, product roadmap, and financial forecasts, and also operating plans.)

The PRD describes the product your company will build.

Also called a spec doc.

The PRD unambiguously articulates the product's purpose, features, functionality and behavior. The product team will use this specification to actually build and test the product. So it needs to be complete enough for them to do their jobs.
