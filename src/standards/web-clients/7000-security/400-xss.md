# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

XSS is the most commonly reported security breach in web client applications.

XSS is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker injects some JavaScript into a webpage, which is then executed by the browser.

Historically, malicious JavaScript has been injected via forms. Nowadays the greater risk comes from scripts that are served via content delivery networks (CDNs). Think about all the JavaScript that you add to your webpages to load fonts, to generate usage analytics, to enable social sharing, and to serve generic JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery. If any one of these third party services is compromised, your application's entire JavaScript environment will be wide open to the attacker.

As with XSRF and other vulnerabilities, a multi-layered security plan is required to protect an application from XSS exploits. At an absolute minimum, all user input MUST be sanitized to remove any executable code before it is stored anywhere. And all user-generated content MUST be escaped before being embedded in HTML documents.

In the second case, you are protecting not only against malicious JavaScript injection, but also unwanted DOM being created from user-generated strings. It is surprising how often this vulnerability turns up. The below screen capture shows one such potential vulnerability we spotted in Azure DevOps in 2022. The user-inputted text string contains the text `<input />` which is rendered as an input control rather than as literal text.

For websites that implement cookie-based authentication, it is also RECOMMENDED to use `HttpOnly` cookies. This prevents the JavaScript environment from accessing cookie data. In the event of a successful XSS injection, at least the malicious program will not be able to access anyone's session ID, and so hijack their session and compromise their account.

For the same reason, session data and sensitive information should not be saved in web storage, which is always accessible via JavaScript APIs.
