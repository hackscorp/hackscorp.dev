# General approach

If statements are for machines, comments are for people.

Comments are annotations in the source code that are ignored by (most) parsers, but which allow developers to leave little notes for each other.

There is a tendency in the JavaScript community to err on the side of terse, tidy code, unblemished by comments. The theory goes that, if the code is sufficiently well presented, then it will be self-documenting, and so comments are superfluous.

At Hacks, we take the opposite view: we don't mind augmenting our code with extensive commentary!

Of course, we should start by making our programs as self-documenting as possible. We can do this by using meaningful function names and descriptive identifiers, and organising our logic in a clear structure that is easy for people to navigate.

But well-written code on its own can only document _what_ the program does. It cannot tell you _why_ the developer chose to implement a piece of logic in the way they did. Comments are how we transfer the rest of our knowledge about our programs to other developers â€” the missing pieces of wisdom that are not explicit in the programs themselves.
