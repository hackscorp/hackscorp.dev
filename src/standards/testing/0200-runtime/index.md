# Runtime testing

Runtime tests — also called dynamic tests — are used to verify the dynamic behavior of computer programs. Runtime tests differ from static tests in that they make assertions on things such as state that change with time. The source code will be compiled and run. By contrast, static tests check for things that are constant in the source code.

Unit tests, integration tests and system tests are [forms of dynamic testing](/standards/testing/runtime/levels).
