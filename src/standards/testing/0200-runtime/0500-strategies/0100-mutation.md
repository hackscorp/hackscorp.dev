# Mutation testing

Tests verify the correctness of the code. But how do you verify the correctness of the tests.

It is important that we scrutinize the efficacy of our tests, to check what they're _actually_ testing. To put it another way, we must pay attention to the quality of our tests, not just their quantity.

Mutation testing is one of the most useful strategies for testing tests. It can be a really powerful way to get better insight into the quality of your tests.

<!--

A good way of checking if your tests have good coverage is to deliberately change the behavior of a component. At least one expectation _should_ fail somewhere.
