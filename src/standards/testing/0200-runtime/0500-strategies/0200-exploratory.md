# Exploratory testing

<!--

Exploratory testing is similar to **black-box testing**. This is the testing of a system in which the tester does not have prior knowledge of how the system was built, and so will have no prior assumptions about how it will work. This contrasts to **white-box testing**, which is the most common mode of testing, in which the tester knows how the system was built, and may even have been involved in its specification.
