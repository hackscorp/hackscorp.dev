# Scope of unit tests

The term "unit" was never meant to refer to an isolated piece of code. It was meant simply to describe a piece of code that you happen to be working with. That piece of code could be a function, a class, a module, a package, or even a whole application.

A unit test can be _any level of abstraction_. Think of the word "unit" as a placeholder for the level of abstraction in which you are working. The unit might be a big chunk or code, or something incredibly tiny.

Remember, unit tests are a _developer tool_, a technique to help us write code. Write the tests at whatever mix of abstraction levels you need to be confident that your code is doing what you think it is doing.

A [classicist ("Detroit") unit testing approach](//blog.devgenius.io/detroit-and-london-schools-of-test-driven-development-3d2f8dca71e5) SHOULD be followed.

In the "London" school of thought, unit testing means testing the behavior of code in small, independent units. Units are typically designed to be the smallest meaningful chunk of independently testable code.
