# Static type checking

Static type checking is a _development tool_ that helps us to write better quality, more correct code before we even execute it. Automatic static type checking tools also remove a whole class of runtime tests, reducing the overall volume of code that needs to be written and maintained.

Computer programs SHOULD be written using toolkits that enable static type checking, ideally in realtime as-you-code.
