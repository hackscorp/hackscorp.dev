# Testing levels

You are going to paint a wall of your house. Which brush will you use? You could use a fine-point brush for everything, but that would take too long and the end result would not look very even. You could use a roller for everything, but that wouldn't allow you to make a nice finish in the corners. You would, of course, use an assortment of brushes, different tools for different use cases.

The same is true of software testing. We use different "levels" of tests to provide complete coverage. One testing level is not better than another, but different levels fulfil different parts of the coverage.

Depending on who you ask, there are three or four main "levels" of software testing:

- Static
- Unit
- Integration
- Functional

The last three require runtime analysis of the program under test, while the first involves static analysis of source code, without it being compiled or executed.
