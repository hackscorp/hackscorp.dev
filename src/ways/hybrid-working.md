# Hybrid working

Hybrid working is a term that came out of the Covid-19 pandemic, which transformed the ways of working for many organisations in the knowledge economy.

In simple terms, hybrid working means allowing people to work from home or the office. At a more fundamental level, it is about giving individuals control over their own working environment, and allowing them to adapt that environment to best suit the requirements of the task at hand.

Our approach to hybrid working enables _complete workplace flexibility_. This means you can:

- Work entirely from home
- Work entirely from the office
- Or work any ratio of home-to-office

They key requirement is to choose the best environment for each thing that you do.

For example, there will be some tasks that are highly **collaborative** in nature, and often times such tasks will be best undertaken in face-to-face with other collaborators. Examples include shared learning experiences, mentoring and coaching, problem solving, and innovation.

But other work will require high levels of **concentration**. For such tasks, you might find yourself being more productive in quite environments. This could be your home, a "snug" area of the office, or even a coffee shop or pub! You decide.

With our approach to hybrid working, there are no fixed rules. The balance between remote and on-site working will vary depending on circumstances. And your own preferences may change over time, too. However, there are some instances where we expect to see people collaborating in person — probably in a local Hacks office — most of the time:

- **Interviewing**: It's hugely beneficial to meet candidates in the flesh. Please do this in the closing stages of recruitment. Ideally, this should be an in-office meetup, so candidates get to meet our people and experience our culture and work environments. But we accept this will not always be practical, and recruiters must prioritise candidates' own preferences. They should feel comfortable, and that may require them controlling the settings in which they interact with us.

- **Onboarding**: There's nothing like welcoming new colleagues in person, is there? New employees do not need to be in the office from day one, but we should encourage them to pop into the office at least once within their probation period.

- **Reviews**: Performance reviews, including probation reviews, should take place face-to-face.

- **One-to-ones**: Everyone should have at least one one-to-one with their line manager ("squad lead") every month. (This may be more regularly for newcomers.) At least once per quarter, this should be in person.

- **Townhalls**: These will be streamed and recorded for those who can't attend, but these are a core part of our culture and we recommend people try to attend these whenever they can.

In summary, balancing purposeful on-site collaboration with productive remote working offers the best of both worlds.
