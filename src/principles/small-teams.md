# Small teams

We aim to have the smallest teams possible, and to grow them carefully.

There's a balance to be found on team size, which varies with the magnitude and complexity of the problem. But in general, smaller teams tend to be more effective than larger ones.

Smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard.

In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and each person feels more responsible to the rest of the team.

The right team of people trumps everything else. Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a whole load of other problems easier to deal with.

<!--

We focus on having small teams of great engineers, rather than large teams of average ones.

The more authors there are, the more coding styles, assumptions and quirks there are to reconcile in the final composite product, exposing a greater surface area for potential issues to arise.

In contrast, a system built by a smaller team of good engineers will be more concise, coherent, and better understood.

The more collaborative an engineering effort, the better the engineers need to be. In large projects, bad engineers end up creating more work for one another. Big projects _need_ to be built on solid, reliable code modules in an efficient design with very clear assumptions laid out. In smaller systems, all of this is a bit more optional.

**The hard limit to system complexity is not quantity of engineering effort, but its quality.**
