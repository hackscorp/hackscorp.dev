# Small teams

We aim to have the smallest teams possible, and to grow them carefully.

There's a balance to be found on team size, which varies with the magnitude and complexity of the problem. But in general, smaller teams tend to be more effective than larger ones.

Smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard.

In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and each person feels more responsible to the rest of the team.

The right team of people trumps everything else. Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a whole load of other problems easier to deal with.
