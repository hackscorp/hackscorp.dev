# Share knowledge

Teaching is a form of learning in disguise.

If you think you know something, try teaching it. Often the act of trying to explain what you know to someone else forces you to formalize your own thoughts more clearly.

Writing things down seems to have a similar effect. That is why we put so much emphasis on good, thorough documentation.

Lift the skills of the people around you, not just yourself. A great team is never a great team because of one or two amazing people. It's a great team because everyone challenges each other and everyone grows together.

So, when you learn something cool, share it. Help the people around you get better, too.
