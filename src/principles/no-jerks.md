# No jerks

We are a company of technical experts, but our professional skill set is — perhaps surprisingly — _not_ the most important factor that drives our success.

The manufacture of software systems is predominantly a creative, collaborative endeavour, rather than the engineering discipline it is widely categorized as.

Unless you're working completely along, it's not just your ability to solve technical problems that matters most, but your effectiveness at working with other people to solve technical problems.

In creative, collaborative enterprises, it is people's soft skills that are more important than their hard skills.

**Soft skills** are universal skills that are beneficial to any endeavour in any setting. Soft skills include things like critical thinking, problem solving, public speaking, professional writing, teamwork, leadership, professional attitude, work ethic, and intercultural fluency. Soft skills are related to wider people skills which cover emotional intelligence and behavioral patterns.

**Hard skills** are the domain-specific skills required in individual professions. In the IT domain, these are technical skills such as the knowledge of programming languages or the design of database systems. These skills are generally quantifiable and measurable, and they tend to be the focus of recruitment processes.

Hard skills are important, sure. But we will never hire someone solely for their hard skills. When choosing whether or not to hire someone, the first question we ask is: will this person fit the team?

We prioritize cultural fit over technical competence, and teamwork is valued far more than individual contributions.

After all, we are a company of people working together to build something. We love working with people who are naturally gifted, and with people who aspire to become exceptional in their chosen field and who work hard to get there. But the talents and graft of those people are valuable to us only if we all get along together.

We have a strict "no jerks" policy! We don't want to work with talented high performers if they are also assholes: if they are commonly rude and disrespectful, unprofessional in work environments, and bully and harass their coworkers. We don't want to work with people who are competitive and ambitious but who try to become successful by demeaning others rather than bettering themselves.

Good performance is no justification for bad behavior. Brilliant jerks are expensive. They erode an organization's culture and values, damage reputation, and reduce productivity through lower morale and higher staff absenteeism and turnover. These individuals are an extreme, but their example serves the purpose of demonstrating the importance of soft skills.

Above all, we value people who exhibit respect, authenticity, integrity, trust, openness, empathy and appreciation. Our focus is the person, not the skill. We don't expect perfection, but we do expect positive, constructive collaboration between our coworkers.

We expect senior engineers to treat people with less knowledge and experience with respect and patience. We all start somewhere, and the journey is a lot more joyful when you're surrounded by patient people who want you to succeed.

Empathy, respect and friendship have been recurring elements of successful engineering teams.

Have opinions. But avoid expressing them in ways that cause other people to believe you won't change them. Expressing our beliefs and opinions is important, and we should all be given the room to do that. However, there's a fine line between sharing an opinion and sounding as though you're sharing an immovable fact. In a team, it's incredibly healthy for everyone to feel like they can challenge an opinion and potentially change it, or their own.

A great piece of advice I received that helps with this is to express your beliefs along with a percentage of how sure you are. "I'm 95% sure using Visual Basic is a bad idea." Even when it's 95%, it's both an opening for someone to question the belief and create a conversation, and an opportunity for you to simply revise your sureness if new information is learned.

It's OK, too, to say "I don't know" or "I need to research that before I have an answer". Let's be honest, none of us have a clue what we're doing! Our industry moves quickly, and while there's lots of new old things, there's a healthy amount of new new things as well. We're all learning every day, and not having an answer is absolutely fine. Our value is not our ability to know everything, it's our ability to learn, to find out, to answer those questions and create new ones.

I'm excited when someone tells me "I don't know" because now I know we can explore the problem together and both learn something. Don't hide it as though you're the only one who doesn't know. Often nobody knows, but your honesty just enabled everyone to join in openly and work together.
