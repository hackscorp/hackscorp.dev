# Built to last

<!--

Software development has been really influenced by the "move fast and break things" philosophy. This is fine... just not in production!

It is dine in design and prototyping. Test new ideas, iterate fast to validate your concept, and be as "lean" as possible in your development.

But things MUST NOT break in production. Assume that production systems are our customers' _critical infrastructure_. When it breaks, they can't do their job properly, and they lose money.

We aspire to precision-engineer **robust, resilient, long-lasting, low-maintenance systems**.

> **Tactical versus strategic coding:** Deciding when to invest for the longer-term isn't easy. Be aware if you are putting out a fire, or building for the long-term. This observation matches my experience: "hacking" something together quickly, just to make it work, versus platformizing (making it reusable, extensible) is a tricky tradeoff to make. While this advice sounds simple, it is the one that requires experience and times of being burnt, to get it right. The challenge here is similar to the software development dilemma of moving fast without breaking things.
