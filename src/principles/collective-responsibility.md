# Collective responsibility

Whole teams are responsible for the code they produce, not the individual team members who wrote the code.

A conversation abut code, good or bad, should never be personal. It should always be professional. Code is merely a moment in time that captured what we thought we knew about something. Talk about the code, or about the problem, but don't make it about the person who wrote it. Use "we" instead of "you".
