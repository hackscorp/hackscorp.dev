# Domain knowledge

More important than understanding the solution space is understanding of the problem space, ie the domain of the organizations or users for which you are producing the software.

Knowledge and understanding of the problem, the business domain and the customer, are just as important — if not more so — than your technical skills.

Understand how something works from first principles, build a solid understanding, and authority will follow.
