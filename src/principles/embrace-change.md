# Embrace change

Change is constant.

Almost everything is always changing, including the rate of change itself.

We need to acknowledge not only that our ability to respond to change is crucial, but that how well we do it (time, cost, quality, reliability) is often a dimension of our competitiveness.

A good design is one in which you can change your mind without changing too much code. We embrace change by designing solutions that allow us to handle change conditions â€” not just external change that occurs around us and takes us along for the ride, but also the internal change that come from pivots, new features, scaling challenges, etc.

A good system design should accommodate, as much as practically possible, our need to change how we approach the problem without forcing us to start over from scratch. In other words, the fewer parts we have to change or remove, the quicker we can move in the face of change. The better the design.
