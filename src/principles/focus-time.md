# Focus time

Today, far more attention is being put on mental health and well-being, and the "work all hours" attitude is become passe.

It is especially important for people to rest. it's incredibly difficult to feel happy when you don't feel rested, and it's even more difficult to do your best work when you're not feeling happy.

To work at our best, we have to spend quality time _not_ working.

Think of your ability to rest as a key part of your ability to work. The same is true for physical exercise and eating well.
