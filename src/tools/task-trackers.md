# Task trackers

<!--

We use a single task tracking system to track issues, bugs, feature requests, customer issues, and processes (such as releases or clean-up efforts).

When sending a source change for review, engineers are prompted to associate the change with a particular issue number.

It is common for teams to regularly scan through open issues in their component(s), prioritizing them and where appropriate assigning them to particular engineers. Some teams have a particular individual responsible for bug triage, others do bug triage in their regular team meetings.

Teams SHOULD make use of labels on bugs to indicated whether bugs have been triaged, and which release(s) each bug is targeted to be fixed in.
