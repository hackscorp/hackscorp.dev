# SSH

SSH – Secure Shell – is a secure protocol for running programs on another computer. It provides a CLI to the connected machine by spawning a remote shell. While connected, all commands that you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote computer and executed there.

SSH is commonly used to remotely provision and maintain web servers — both "bare metal" and virtual.
