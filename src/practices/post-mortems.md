# Post-mortems

<!--

Whenever there is a significant outage to any of our production systems, or similar mishap, the people involved are required to write a post-mortem document.

This document describes the incident, including title, summary, impact, timeline, root cause(s), what worked/didn't work, and action items.

The focus of this document is on the problems and how to avoid them in the future, not on the people or apportioning blame.

The impact section tries to quantify the effect of the incident, in terms of duration of outage, number of lost queries (or failed RPCs, etc) and revenue.

The timeline section gives a timeline of events leading up to the outage and the steps taken to diagnose and rectify it.

The what worked / didn't work section describes the lesson learnt â€” which practices helped to quickly detect and resolve the issue, what went wrong, and what concrete actions (preferably logged in the task tracker) can be taken to reduce the likelihood and/or severity of similar problems in the future.

The post-mortem document is elevated to the product owner and the feedback is used to improve how we do engineering...
