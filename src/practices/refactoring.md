# Refactoring

Refactoring is the refinement of a block of code without changing its behavior or public interface.

Refactoring is often, rather clumsily, labelled as [technical debt](/standards/quality-metrics/technical-debt) or bundled with more general [maintenance](practices/maintenance) activities. But it is actually a very specific practice.

We have dedicated _refactoring sprints_, in which we allocate blocks of time in which teams are free to improve the internal quality of their code however they like. They are not closing down technical debt tickets or chasing quality metrics. All they are doing is improving the _quality_ of the implementation.
