# Apprenticeships

We intend to offer apprenticeships at Hacks, as we think this is the best environment for people to learn software development.

Apprentices will be paired with senior developers who will provide mentoring. Initially, apprentices will pair programme with their mentor, though apprentices are encouraged to contribute to production code individually, as soon as they are comfortable doing so.

Mistakes will be made. That's okay. All engineers, regardless of experience, make mistakes. Parenting is about providing a safe environment in which your kids can learn by trying things and making mistakes, and the same is true for apprenticeships. Our quality assurance procedures should be robust enough to handle it.
