# Stand-ups

Stand-ups are daily meetings where team members come together to share updates on their progress. Done correctly, they can have a huge impact on team cohesion.

Stand-ups — also known as "daily scrums" in Scrum-based development processes — SHOULD be short and straight to the point. Even if everyone is dialing in to the meeting remotely from the comfort of their home sofa, stand-up meetings should be conducted like everyone is standing huddled together in the corner of the office, having come together for a quick debrief.

For each member in a team, the main three things to communicate in the daily stand-up are:

- **What I did**: what progress was made on their current task since the last stand-up.
- **What I'm doing**: the member's objectives for the next day or two.
- **What's blocking me**: any obstacles or roadblocks being encountered, and what you need to resolve them.

A stand-up SHOULD NOT be more than 15 minutes in total duration.

Stand-ups may be done in the morning or afternoon, though generally they work best early in the day before everyone has gotten stuck in to their day's work. The main thing is that all team members jointly agree the time of their daily stand-ups. This is not a decision to be _imposed_ upon a team, either by the team lead or by anyone else. A team's stand-up schedule MUST be a mutually agreed time is convenient for everyone on the team.

[Some people think that daily stand-ups are pointless.](//codethrasher.com/post/2019-10-06-the-pointlessness-of-daily-standups/) Indeed, we don't put too many expectations on stand-ups. But done right, they can be a useful way of reducing the level of noise that would otherwise be scattered throughout the day.
