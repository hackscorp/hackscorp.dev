# Retrospectives

The purpose of retrospectives is to continuously evolve our process, tools and techniques.

If we didn't have retrospectives, we would forever use the same languages, techniques and processes we've always used, without any refinement.

Our retrospectives are broader in scope that the twice-monthly retro ceremonies you get in Scrum-based processes. We do retrospectives much less often, but when we do, they are bigger and more ambitious. We aim to learn not only from our own successes and failures, but from ideas and innovations emerging from elsewhere in the global IT industry.
