# Testing

Testing is a major part of our software engineering [process](/process). Specifically, we practice **test-driven development**.

It is our view that the most critical phases of systems engineering are those at the beginning and end of the lifecycle: the initial [analysis](/process/phases/analysis) of a problem, which includes requirements gathering, and the [testing](/process/phases/testing) of the eventual solution. Get these right, and the other phases, including the actual [implementation](/process/phases/implementation), become much easier than they would otherwise be, saving valuable time and resources.

Read more about our approach to testing in our [testing standards](/standards/testing) documentation.
